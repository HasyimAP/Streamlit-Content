## About The Dataset

The COVID-19 dataset in Indonesia was created to find out various factors that could be taken into consideration in decision making related to the level of stringency in each province in Indonesia.

Data compiled based on time series, both on a country level (Indonesia), and on a province level. If needed in certain provinces, it might also be provided at the city / regency level.
Demographic data is also available, as well as calculations between demographic data and COVID-19 pandemic data.
