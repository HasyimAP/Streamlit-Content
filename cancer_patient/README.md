Cancer is a disease in which some of the body's cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. 
Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide and is responsible for 16.5% of all deaths. 
Lung cancer is the most common subtype of cancer that causes death. 
Some of the biggest risk factors for developing cancer include obesity, tobacco smoking, viral infections, UV radiation overexposure, genetic predispositions and regular alcohol consumption. 
Symptoms of cancer vary and are location-specific but may include a persistent lump, pain, weight loss, fatigue and persistent coughing.
