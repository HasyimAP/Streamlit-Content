# CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Greenhouse gases trap heat and make the planet warmer. 
Human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last hundred years. 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions from the sector, 
but smaller amounts of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are also emitted. 
These gases are released during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to produce electricity. 
Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities strengthen the greenhouse effect, contributing to climate change.
